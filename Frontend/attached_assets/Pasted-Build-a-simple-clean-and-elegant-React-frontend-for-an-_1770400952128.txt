Build a simple, clean, and elegant React frontend for an NGO website that serves retired government employees and pensioners.

The target users are elderly (60+), not tech-savvy, so the UI must be calm, readable, accessible, and intuitive.

❗ Avoid the typical “tacky government website” look.
❗ No clutter, no bright colors, no overengineering.

Design Principles:

Minimal, modern, and respectful design

Large readable fonts (minimum 18px)

High contrast text

Plenty of white space

Soft neutral background (off-white / light gray)

One primary color (calm blue or muted green)

Simple icons (no animations, no carousels)

Fast-loading, lightweight UI

Tech Constraints:

React frontend only

Functional components

Clean folder structure

React Router for navigation

No backend logic

No external heavy UI libraries

Pages to include (refined & meaningful):
1. Home

Brief introduction of the NGO

Mission statement (supporting pensioners & retired officials)

Quick links to key sections

One simple, respectful hero section (no flashy images)

2. About / Activities

Rename this section to “Our Activities”

List activities such as:

Pension-related assistance

Grievance support

Awareness programs

Community meetings

Simple card layout, one activity per card

3. Notices & Updates

Rename this section to “Notices & Updates”

Display recent announcements:

Pension updates

Meeting notices

Important circulars

Clean list format with date and title

4. Facilities for Pensioners

Rename to “Facilities & Support”

Clearly list benefits:

Pension guidance

Legal awareness

Healthcare support information

Help with government schemes

Use bullet points and icons for clarity

5. Members

Rename to “Committee Members”

Simple list or grid:

Name

(Optional) Contact info

No profile photos required initially

6. Gallery

Rename to “Photo Gallery”

Display images of:

7. Contact Us

Simple and minimal

Code Quality:
